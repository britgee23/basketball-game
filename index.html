        <p>How to Play Three-Point-Shootout<br><br><br>
          Choose your difficulty setting: Rookie is the easiest and All-Star is the most challenging. <br>
          Start the Shot Clock by clicking on the basketball.<br>
          Click and hold the basketball to begin shooting.<br>
          Release the click when the meter fills up green and says "Shoot!"<br>
          A message will appear in the upper right corner giving you feedback on your shot.<br>
          The ball will reappear in a random location along the shooting line.<br>
          Each made shot is worth 1 point, except the "Money Ball" which is worth 2 points.<br>
          Score the most amount of points within the time limit to win!
